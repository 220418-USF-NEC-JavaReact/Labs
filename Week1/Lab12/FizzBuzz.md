# In the provided method in `FizeBuzz.java` implement the logic to the following coding problem

## FizzBuzz

You are given a number N.

If the number N is divisible by 3 return the String "Fizz".

If the number N is divisible by 5 return the String "Buzz".

If The number N is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5 return the String "FizzBuzz"

If none of the above are true, return the number N as a string

(Hint) You may need to rearrange the ordering of the checks above to make the program work properly

## Once you have completed the logic, compile the `FizeBuzz.java` file

## Run the Lab12.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
