# Create a class called `Calculator` with the following methods

1. A method called `add` which takes two integers and returns the numbers added

2. A method called `sub` which takes two integers and returns the numbers subtracted

3. A method called `multiply` which takes two doubles and returns the numbers multiplied

4. A method called `divide` which takes two doubles and returns the numbers divided

## Once you have written the class completely with all of the above members compile the `Calculator.java` file

## Run the Lab4.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
