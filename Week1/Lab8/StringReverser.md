# In the `StringReverser.java` file, write code to do the following:

## Complete the following method using a StringBuilder or StringBuffer

Create a public method called `reverse` which returns a String

- The methods should take one parameter String, which is the String to be reversed

Using Java operators and control flow reverse the input String

- As you are reversing the String, store the characters into a StringBuilder or StringBuffer
- (Hint) This can be done with a single for loop, and no extra temporary variables

After the String is reversed convert the contents of the StringBuilder or Buffer into a String and return it

**NOTE YOU WILL NOT GET CREDIT IF YOU USE THE STRINGBUILDER OR STRINGBUFFER REVERSE METHOD**

## Once you have completed the logic, compile the `StringReverser.java` file

## Run the Lab8.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
