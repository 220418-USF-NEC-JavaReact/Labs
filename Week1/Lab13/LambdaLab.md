# In the `LambdaLab.java` file, write code to do the following:

## Give the one method from the functional interface the following logic

1. Create an instance of the GenericInterface called `factorial`

-   The parameter of the function should take in an int
-   It should return the factorial of the given integer
    -   Research factorial, the algorithm is very straight forward
-   (Hint) because of the generic, you will have to cast the parameter as an Integer object

2. Create an instance of the GenericInterface called `reverse`

-   The parameter of the function should take in a String
-   It should return the reversed String
-   (Hint) because of the generic you will have to cast the parameter as a String object

3. Create a new public method called `forEachReverse` which returns a List of String

-   The method should take in a List of String as a parameter
-   Using the forEach method of the List loop through all of the Strings
-   Using a lambda reverse the current String and place it into a new list
-   Return the list when done
    (Hint) You are allowed to reuse logic from above

## Once you have completed the logic, compile the `LambdaLab.java` file

## Compile the Lab13.java file

## Run the Lab13.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
