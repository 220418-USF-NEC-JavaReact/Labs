# In the method provided in the `TicTacToe.java` file, write code to do the following:

## Simulate a tic tac toe game between two friends

1. Create a 2d character array called `tictactoe`

-   The array should model a tic tac toe board which is 3x3

2. All spaces of the board should be initialized as underscores `_`

3. Programatically play out the following game:

-   Player X plays in the exact middle spot (1,1)
-   Player O plays in the middle row left column (1,0)
-   Player X plays in the top row right column (0,2)
-   Player O plays in the bottom row left column (2,0)
-   Player X plays in the top row left column (0,0)
-   Player O plays in the bottom row middle column (2,1)
-   Player X plays in the top row middle column and WINS (0,1)

4. While playing the above game, replace the underscores in the 2d array with the corresponding character of either player

## Once you have completed the logic, compile the `TicTacToe.java` file

## Compile the Lab3.java file

## Run the Lab3.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
