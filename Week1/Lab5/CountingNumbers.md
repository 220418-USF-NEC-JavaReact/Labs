# In the method provided in the `CountingNumbers.java` file, write code to do the following:

1. Create an integer array with 100 indexes called `numbers`

2. Using a for loop fill the `numbers` array with the numbers 1 to 100

3. Create two new integer variables

- One called evenSum set to 0
- One called oddSum set to 0

4. Create a while loop which loops through the previously set `numbers` array and do the following

- if the number is even add the number to the evenSum variable
- otherwise add the number to the oddSum variable
- (Hint) You can use the modulus operator (%) to see if there is a remainder after dividing a number by 2
- (Hint) You may need to use another variable to know when to break out of the while loop

## Once you have completed the logic, compile the `CountingNumbers.java` file

## Run the Lab5.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
