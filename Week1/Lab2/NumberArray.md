# In the method provided in the `NumbersArray.java` file, write code to do the following:

## Create an integer array called `fib` with 5 indexes

1. Inside of the array store the first 5 digits of the fibonacci sequence, including 0

2. Create a new integer variable called `fourthDigit` and get the third number of the fibonacci sequence from the array that you created

## Once you have completed the logic, compile the `NumberArray.java` file

## Run the Lab2.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
