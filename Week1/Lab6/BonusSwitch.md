# In the method provided in the `BonusSwitch.java` file, write code to do the following:

## You will be given a array with a random about of characters by the test runner

1. Create an integer array called `bonuses` the same size as the given character array

-   (Hint) You can use the length property of the array object to find the size

2. Using a do while loop, loop through the given character array

-   (Hint) You may need a variable to keep track of when to stop the loop

3. Inside of the do while loop block, create a switch statement, that switches on a character given from an index of the character array

4. Fill in the `bonuses` array inside of the switch statement according to the following logic

-   The letter `A` gets a 5000 bonus
-   The letter `B` gets a 2500 bonus
-   The letter `C` gets a 1000 bonus
-   The letter `D` gets a 500 bonus
-   The letter `F` gets a 0 bonus

## Example character and result array:

character array = ['A', 'A', 'C', 'F']
bonuses = [5000, 5000, 1000, 0]

## Once you have completed the logic, compile the `BonusSwitch.java` file

## Run the Lab6.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
