# Create a class with primitive members

## Write a Java class called `Primitives` with the following class members

1. A boolean called `boo` which stores the value of true

2. A byte called `maxByte` which stores the max value of a byte datatype in Java

3. A short called `minShort` which stores the minimum value of a short datatype in Java

4. An int called `maxInt` which stores the maximum value of an integer datatype in Java

5. A long called `javaFlex` which stores the approximate amount of devices Java code currently runs on

-   (Hint) It starts with a 3

6. A float called `pie` which stores the value of pie to the first 5 decimals (rounded down)

7. A decimal called `doubleYum` which stores the value of pie to the first 5 decimals rounded down times 2

## Once you have written the class completely with all of the above members compile the `Primitives.java` file

## Run the Lab1.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
