# With your project 1 partner, create a full stack project as described below

## Ethan has a hard time keeping track of what groceries he needs from the store every week

Using the skills you have learned so far, create a simple webpage to keep track of a list of groceries Ethan needs to buy

## Requirements

Create a simple Java backend with Javalin

-   You can get away with a single model

Create a database with a single table which holds all the items Ethan still needs to purchase

The Backend will need a DAO to Create, Read, Update, and Delete grocery items from the database

Give the list a user interface with HTML

-   Display the items on the page
-   Allow Ethan to input new items to his list using a form
    -   New items should be stored in the database
-   Allow Ethan to delete items from his list
    -   The delete items should be removed from the database
-   (Stretch) Allow Ethan to update/modify items on the list from the UI
    -   The item changes should be reflected on the database

Use JS and Fetch to make HTTP requests to the Java backend

Use Javlin, and HTTP handlers to receive and process the HTTP requests on the backend

## Use paired programming to develop this mini project

### Be prepared to explain how you did it, and why you made the choices you did
