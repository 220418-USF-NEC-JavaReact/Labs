# In the provided method in `Candles.java` implement the logic to the following coding problem

## Birtday Candles

You are in charge of the cake for a child's birthday. You have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of their total age. They will only be able to blow out the tallest of the candles. Count how many candles are the tallest.

The method will take in an `int[] candles` which is a list of the candles heights.

This method should return the number of candles which are the max height in the list

## Example:

```
candles = [3,2,1,3]

3 is the max height in the list, and there are 2 instances of 3

The integer 2 should be returned from the method
```

## Once you have completed the logic, compile the `Candles.java` file

## Run the Lab16.class file to see if you have successfully completed the lab
