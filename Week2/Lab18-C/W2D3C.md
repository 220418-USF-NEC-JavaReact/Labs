# In the provided method in `WordCount.java` implement the logic to the following coding problem

## Word Count

You are given a string of text as input. Your job is to count the number of times each unique word appears in the text and then store each word in a Map, along with the number of times it was been seen.

For this problem, words are defined as any characters separated by spaces. Punctuation will not be included in the input text, only alphanumeric characters, and capitalization can be ignored.

## Complete the `count` method below:

The method will take in a single `String input`

This method should return the Map which the word is the key, and the number of times it has been seen is the value

## Example

```
input = "hello world hello friend"

The words:
- hello: appears two times
- world: appears once
- friend: appears once

The output would be a map with the following data:

returned = {
    hello: 2
    world: 1
    friend: 1
}
```

## Once you have completed the logic, compile the `WordCount.java` file
